# Photography Portfolio

I'm passionate about taking photos - a lot of them. I started with a camera in my hand when I was 7 and I've been taking pictures and loving every second of it ever since. I can't go anywhere without a camera, just like my dad and his dad before him and... well you get the idea - it's a family thing. Photography has introduced me to some awesome people and taken me to some truly amazing places.
