# Hello World!

## I'm Adam.

I live in South Carolina and I study computer engineering at Clemson University. I've always been enthusiastic about technology and I look forward to pursuing this interest professionally. 

I enjoy photography (film and digital) following a passion that's been in the family for generations. Web design, hiking, exploring the mountains, and droning are just a couple other ways I spend my free time.
