# Hello World!

## I'm Adam.

I'm a computer engineer, web designer, and photographer from upstate South Carolina. 

I graduated with my B.S. in Computer Engineering in 2020 and my M.S. in Computer Engineering specializing in Intelligent Systems in 2021 from Clemson University. I aspire to work professionally developing computer vision software utilizing machine learning.

When Iâ€™m not behind a computer, you can find me hiking or exploring with a camera in my hand. Oh, and I really like the mountains.
