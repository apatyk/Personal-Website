  text: I’m a photographer, software engineer, and outdoor enthusiast from upstate South Carolina now living in Colorado. When I’m not behind a computer, you can find me hiking or exploring the great outdoors with a camera in my hand. I recently finished visiting all 48 contiguous United States (plus Puerto Rico) before turning 25. Now, as I look to the next chapter in my life, I'm setting my sights on our National Parks!
