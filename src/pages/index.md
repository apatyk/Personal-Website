  text: I’m a photographer, computer engineer, and outdoor enthusiast from upstate South Carolina. When I’m not behind a computer, you can find me hiking or exploring with a camera in my hand. I have a goal to visit all 50 states before I'm 25 and I'm getting pretty close. Track my progress on the map below.
