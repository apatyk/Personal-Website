# Hello World!

## I'm Adam.

I live in South Carolina and I am currently studying computer engineering at Clemson University. I have always been enthusiastic about technology and I look forward to pursuing this interest professionally.

Currently, I am a self-employed, part-time web developer specializing in responsive design. I am also a hobbyist photographer (film and digital) following a passion that's been in the family for generations. Hiking, exploring the mountains, and droning are just a couple other ways I spend my free time.
