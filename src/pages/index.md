# Hello World!

## I'm Adam.

I'm a computer engineer, web designer, and photographer from upstate South Carolina. 

I graduated with my B.S. in Computer Engineering from Clemson University in 2020.  I’m currently pursuing an M.S. at Clemson in Computer Engineering specializing in Intelligent Systems. 

After graduation, I aspire to work professionally developing computer vision software utilizing machine learning. I am also passionate about embedded systems and network security.

When I’m not behind a computer, you can find me hiking or exploring with a camera in my hand. Oh, and I really like the mountains.
